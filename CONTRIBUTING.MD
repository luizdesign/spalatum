# Contributor's Guide

You can contribute in many ways: openning or participating of a issue, reporting a bug, sending a [pull request](#submitting-a-pull-request).

## Getting Started
1.  Fork the project, [Help Guide to Fork a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
2.  Clone the project.
3.  Create a branch specific to the issue you are working on.
    ```sh
    git checkout -b update-readme-file
    ```

4.  Open up the project in your favourite text editor, select the file you want to contribute to and make your changes.

5.  After making your changes in the new git branch then add your modified files to git, [How to add, commit, push and go](http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2/)

    ```sh
    git add path/to/filename.ext
    ```

    You can also add all unstaged files using:
    ```sh
    git add .
    ```

    Note, using a `git add .` will automatically add all files. You can do a `git status` to see your changes, but do it before `git add`.

6.  Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

    ```sh
    git commit -m "Brief Description of Commit"
    ```
7.  Push your commits to your Fork:

    ```sh
    git push -u origin branch-name
    ```
8.  Submit a pull request.
